Generative AI has a wide range of applications in various tasks and activities. 




1. **Generation**: Generative AI can create content, such as writing blog posts, composing emails, or generating images. It can intuitively produce text or visual content based on a given input.
2. **Extraction**: This involves extracting specific data from a larger dataset. For example, a generative AI system can extract tables from a PDF and convert them into a format compatible with applications like Microsoft Excel.
3. **Summarization**: Generative AI can take large volumes of text and condense it into shorter, summarized versions. This is useful for creating meeting notes from conference call transcripts or summarizing lengthy articles.
4. **Rewriting**: This task involves rephrasing content. For instance, it can convert text from one language to another, explain complex concepts in simpler terms, or transform informal content into professional documents.
5. **Classification**: Generative AI can automatically categorize and classify text into predefined topics or categories. For example, it can analyze a collection of blog posts and assign them to relevant topics without manual intervention.
6. **Question Answering**: Generative AI can be used to ask questions and retrieve answers from a body of knowledge or documents. For instance, it can be employed to assess whether an RFP response meets specific conditions or requirements.
