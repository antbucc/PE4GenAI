This is a course that will give you a hands-on introduction to the core concepts and best practices on prompt engineering for generative AI (PE4GenAI).
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

 - Understand prompt engineering concepts and best practices
 - Apply prompt engineering techniques to your own
 - Grasp ethical considerations surrounding prompt engineering and its applications.


## Course Outline

The course is organized into sections, taking you from "understanding" (core concepts) to "doing" (hands-on exercises). You can then any remaining session time for open-ended exploration to build your own intuition for prompt engineering.

1. [Introduction](/survey). Fill the survey.
2. [Generative AI Intro and Cards](/intro). Understand and Create your genAI cards.
3. [Setup](/setup). Activate your access to the custom course Playground.
4. [Part 1](/Part-1-labs/Basic-Prompting/). Learn the basics of interacting with the GPT Models .
5. [Part 2](/Part-2-labs/System-Message/). Learn how to guide the models to â€‹create better answers.
6. [Concepts & resources](/Workshop-Interact-with-OpenAI-models/ai-models/).
7. [Learnings and Resources](/summary). Recap what you learned & identify next steps.
