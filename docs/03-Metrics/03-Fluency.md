# Fluency

**Fluency** measures the quality of individual sentences in the **output**, and whether they are well-written and grammatically correct. Consider the quality of individual inputs when evaluating fluency. Given the input and output, score the fluency of the output between one to five stars using the following rating scale:

1. **One star:** the answer completely lacks fluency

2. **Two stars:** the answer mostly lacks fluency

3. **Three stars:** the answer is partially fluent

4. **Four stars:** the answer is mostly fluent

5. **Five stars:** the answer has perfect fluency

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
