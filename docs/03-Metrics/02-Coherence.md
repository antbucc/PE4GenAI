# Coherence

**Coherence** of an answer is measured by how well all the ***sentences fit together and sound naturally as a whole***. Consider the overall quality of the **output** when evaluating coherence. 

Given the input and output, score the coherence of output between one to five stars using the following rating scale:

1. **One star:** the answer completely lacks coherence
2. **Two stars:** the answer mostly lacks coherence
3. **Three stars:** the answer is partially coherent
4. **Four stars:** the answer is mostly coherent
5. **Five stars:** the answer has perfect coherency

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
