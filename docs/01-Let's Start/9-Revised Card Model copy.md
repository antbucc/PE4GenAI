# Generative AI 'CARD' 

In the context of this course, a **card** refers to a structured format or **template** used to define a specific ***task*** or ***objective*** for generating content or output using generative AI techniques.


**Card Model with Preconditions**

1. **Objective:** The overarching goal or purpose of the generative AI task. This defines what needs to be achieved through the content generation process.

2. **Input:** Information provided to the generative AI technique to guide the content generation process. This includes:
   - **Prompt:** A starting point or stimulus to generate content. It could be a partial sentence, a keyword, or any other form of input that triggers the generation process.
   - **Context or Preconditions:** Additional information or constraints that provide context for the generation task. This may include background knowledge, relevant data sources, or specific requirements.

3. **Output:** The generated content produced by the generative model in response to the input. This includes:
   - **Generated Text:** The actual output generated by the AI model, which could be in the form of text, images, or other media depending on the task.
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** Criteria used to assess the quality and relevance of the generated content. This may include measures of coherence, relevance, grammaticality, and other factors depending on the specific task requirements.
