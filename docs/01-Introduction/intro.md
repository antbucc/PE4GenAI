# Introduction to Generative AI and Large Language Models


Generative AI is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images and other types of content. What makes it a fantastic technology is that it democratizes AI, anyone can use it with as little as a text **prompt**, a sentence written in a **natural language**. There's no need for you to learn a language like Java or SQL to accomplish something worthwhile, all you need is to use your language, state what you want and out comes a suggestion from an AI model. The applications and impact for this is huge, you write or understand reports, write applications and much more, all in seconds. 

In this course, we’ll explore how our startup leverages generative AI to unlock new scenarios in the education world and how we address the inevitable challenges associated with the social implications of its application and the technology limitations.

## Introduction

This lesson will cover:

* Introduction to the business scenario: our startup idea and mission.
* Generative AI and how we landed on the current technology landscape.
* Inner working of a large language model.
* Main capabilities and practical use cases of Large Language Models.

## Learning Goals

After completing this lesson, you will understand:

* What generative AI is and how Large Language Models work.
* How you can leverage large language models for different use cases, with a focus on education scenarios.

## Scenario: our educational startup 

**Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI)** represents the pinnacle of AI technology, pushing the boundaries of what was once thought impossible. Generative AI models have several capabilities and applications, but for this course we'll explore how it's revolutionizing education through a fictional startup. We'll refer to this startup as *our startup*. Our startup works in the **education domain** with the ambitious mission statement of 

> *improving accessibility in learning, on a global scale, ensuring equitable access to education and providing personalized learning experiences to every learner, according to their needs*.

Our startup team is aware we’ll not be able to achieve this goal without leveraging one of the most powerful tools of modern times – Large Language Models (LLMs).

Generative AI is expected to revolutionize the way we learn and teach today, with students having at their disposal virtual teachers 24 hours a day who provide vast amounts of information and examples, and teachers able to leverage innovative tools to assess their students and give feedback.


To start, let’s define some basic concepts and terminology we’ll be using throughout the course.

## How did we get Generative AI?

Despite the extraordinary *hype* created lately by the announcement of generative AI models, this technology is decades in the making, with the first research efforts dating back to 60s. We're now at a point with AI having human cognitive capabilities, like conversation as shown by for example [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) or [Bing Chat](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/features/bing-chat?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst), which also uses a GPT model for the web search Bing conversations.

Backing up a bit, the  very first prototypes of AI consisted of typewritten chatbots, relying on a knowledge base extracted from a group of experts and represented into a computer. The answers in the knowledge base were triggered by keywords appearing in the input text.
However, it soon became clear that such approach, using typewritten chatbots, did not scale well.

### A statistical approach to AI: Machine Learning

A turning point arrived during the 90s, with the application of a statistical approach to text analysis. This led to the development of new algorithms – known with the name of **machine learning** - able to learn patterns from data, without being explicitly programmed. This approach allows a machine to simulate human language understanding: a statistical model is trained on text-label pairings, enabling the model to classify unknown input text with a pre-defined label representing the intention of the message.

### Neural networks and modern virtual assistants

In more recent times, the technological evolution of the hardware, capable of handling larger amounts of data and more complex computations, encouraged research in the AI fields, leading to the development of advanced machine learning algorithms – called **neural networks** or **deep learning** algorithms.

Neural networks (and in particular Recurrent Neural Networks – RNNs) significantly enhanced natural language processing, enabling the representation of the meaning of text in a more meaningful way, valuing the context of a word in a sentence.

This is the technology that powered the virtual assistants born in the first decade of the new century, very proficient in interpreting the human language, identifying a need, and performing an action to satisfy it – like answering with a pre-defined script or consuming a 3rd party service.
