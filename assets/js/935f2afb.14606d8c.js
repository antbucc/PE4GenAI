What makes it a fantastic technology is that it democratizes AI, anyone can use it with as little as a text prompt, a sentence written in a natural language. There\'s no need for you to learn a language like Java or SQL to accomplish something worthwhile, all you need is to use your language, state what you want and out comes a suggestion from an AI model. The applications and impact for this is huge, you write or understand reports, write applications and much more, all in seconds.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Welcome":{"id":"Welcome","title":"Welcome","description":"This is a course that will give you a hands-on introduction to the core concepts and best practices on prompt engineering for generative AI (PE4GenAI).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
