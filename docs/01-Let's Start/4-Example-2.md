**Objective:** 
Generate mathematical exercises for elementary school students to practice multiplication.

**Input:**
- Prompt: "Create multiplication exercises for elementary school students."
- Context: Specify the range of numbers involved in the multiplication (e.g., numbers between 1 and 10), indicate the number of exercises required, and specify whether any special multiplication concepts (e.g., times tables, repeated addition) need to be included.

**Output:** 
- Generated Text: "1. 2 x 3 =  
                      1. 5 x 4 =  
                      2. 7 x 2 =  
                      3. 9 x 1 =  
                      4. 3 x 8 =  
                      ..."

**Evaluation Metrics:** 
- Coherence: Assess the logical flow and consistency of the generated exercises.
- Relevance: Determine whether the exercises are relevant to the prompt and context provided.
- Grammaticality: Check the grammatical correctness of the generated exercises and their presentation.

**Feedback Loop:** 
Collect feedback from teachers and students on the quality and effectiveness of the generated exercises. Use this feedback to refine the generative model, adjust the range of numbers, modify the types of exercises generated, and improve the clarity and coherence of the output. Additionally, monitor the performance of the model over time and incorporate additional training data to enhance its ability to generate high-quality multiplication exercises.
